Agentic artificial intelligence systems promise autonomous adaptation and self-directed problem solving, yet their adoption in regulated domains hinges on verifiable transparency. In recent deployments I have observed that practitioners still rely on coarse attribution estimates derived from gradient saliency maps, even though these signals often collapse under distributional drift. I argue that an interpretable agentic stack must start with causal specification of decision objectives. Structural causal models provide a formal scaffold that distinguishes policy intent from the mutable patterns surfaced by data-driven planners. By encoding policy constraints as counterfactual queries, it becomes possible to debug agent trajectories with surgical precision.

Once the causal blueprint has been agreed, we can layer programmatic explainability mechanisms that survive temporal feedback. I advocate for steward policies encoded as temporal logic monitors. They act as continuous auditors over the agentâ€™s plan space and yield human-readable violation reports without interrupting online adaptation. The monitors can be aligned with safety envelopes determined by domain experts, enabling governance teams to treat explainability artefacts as compliance evidence rather than anecdotal narratives.

The final pillar is evaluative reproducibility. Agentic systems refactor themselves through experience, which means an explanation captured today might degrade tomorrow. To counter this drift, I design replay archives curated via influence functions that prioritise scenarios most critical to the monitored specifications. When an auditor requests justification, the system regenerates explanations from the archived context so that investigators can reproduce the decision path exactly. Collectively, causal specifications, temporal monitors, and influence-weighted archives transform agentic AI from an opaque optimisation engine into a transparent collaborator ready for enterprise scale oversight.
