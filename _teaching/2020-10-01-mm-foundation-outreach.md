From Jun 2018 to Oct 2020 I served as a student volunteer leader with the MM Foundation Village Outreach Program, where we tackled the digital divide in rural Punjab through sustained computer literacy initiatives. I coordinated a cohort of volunteers to deliver over fifty workshops that combined introductory computing, internet safety, and applied problem-solving tailored to local agricultural and small business needs. Our sessions equipped more than five hundred participants with practical digital skills, including spreadsheet-based budgeting and smartphone-enabled market research.

Beyond classroom delivery, I instituted a mentorship track that paired motivated learners with university students for follow-up coaching. This structure fostered long-term knowledge retention and helped several participants launch micro-enterprises leveraging e-commerce platforms. The experience reinforced my commitment to inclusive technology education and informed the community engagement practices I now apply in industry training programmes.
