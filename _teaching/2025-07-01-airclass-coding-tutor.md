During my tenure as a coding tutor with AirClass (Jan 2020 – Jul 2025) I delivered personalised, project-based instruction in Python, data science, and applied AI to more than one hundred learners across Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. I designed modular curricula that paired foundational programming concepts with capstone applications, from computer vision mini-projects to end-to-end analytics dashboards, ensuring that each student built a tangible portfolio demonstrating both algorithmic understanding and practical problem-solving.

The programme emphasised active learning and continuous assessment. I incorporated live code reviews, reflective learning journals, and formative quizzes that mapped progress against competency rubrics co-created with AirClass academic coordinators. This approach consistently lifted student confidence, culminating in a 94% average improvement in post-module assessments and several national competition placements for participant teams.
