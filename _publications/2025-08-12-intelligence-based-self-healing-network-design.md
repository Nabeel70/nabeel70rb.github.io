The study introduces an AI and machine learning powered automated incident response system (AIRS) for IoT networks. By enabling self-healing network routines, the framework cuts mean time to respond, scales across smart city and industrial IoT scenarios, and lays the groundwork for future extensions with federated learning and privacy preserving models.
