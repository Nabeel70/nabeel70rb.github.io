This work presents a stacked LSTM intrusion detection system tailored for IoT environments using the NSL-KDD dataset. The approach combines chi-square based feature engineering with deep sequence modeling to raise precision, recall, and overall robustness against DoS, intrusions, and data leakage. The resulting model strengthens IoT infrastructure security while remaining scalable for large deployments.
