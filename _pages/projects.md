    <h2><a href="https://github.com/Nabeel70/Is-It-Rain">Will It Rain on My Parade? (NASA Space Apps Challenge)</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Oct 2025</p>
    <p>Led a hackathon team that fused NASA Earth observation data, reinforcement learning, and geospatial analytics to deliver personalised rainfall forecasts for event planners. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J7zV1Ge2kbsCQhzwMLwUy-sDBMEWc59-/view">demo</a> showcases location-aware precipitation probability maps, confidence metrics, and AI-driven insights powered by Random Forest ensembles trained on IMERG rainfall archives.</p>
    <p>The application allows users to specify dates and locations, returning interpretable summaries of the likelihood of “very wet” or other adverse weather conditions. It integrates NASA POWER datasets, Giovanni workflows, and custom reinforcement learning pipelines that optimise query planning to reduce latency. Planned extensions include mobile notifications, POWER-based thermal indicators, and advanced AI models for hyper-local forecasts.</p>
